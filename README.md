Gruvdrift.se
============
A web and minecraft interface (using a kind of rest api) for the
community at gruvdrift.nu.


Sub projects
------------
mc-mugshot is a little python script intended to run as a cronjob. It
creates the player skin based avatars for the site.


Historically
------------

We used a python based proxy called wohasock for whitelisting etc, now we have migrated to
[WohaPlug](http://github.com/blambi/WohaPlug).

That was fine until bukkit died a horrible death, so now we will have
to use rcon to sync the whitelist.

Artwork
------- 

The dirt and grass background are based on textures in
[Isabella texture pack](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/242175-16x125-isabella-12v3-1-year-anniversary-of-isabella-april-4-2012/)
